		<p>A long, long time ago, there lived a boy so small and thin that everyone called him Little Thumb. He had six older brothers, who were also just as skinny as Little Thumb, because their parents were so poor that they couldn&rsquo;t afford enough food for them. The father was a woodcutter, but no one bought his wood since everyone in the area was just as poor.</p>
		<p>One night, Little Thumb&rsquo;s stomach growled so loudly that he couldn&rsquo;t sleep. He snuck downstairs to see if he could find a few crumbs of bread. In the kitchen, he overheard his father sighing, &ldquo;Wife, we&rsquo;re completely out of food. There&rsquo;s no other choice. Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll take the children to the forest and leave them there.&rdquo; Little Thumb couldn&rsquo;t believe his ears&mdash;who would do something so terrible? But that&rsquo;s how things go in fairy tales.</p>
		<p>Little though he was, he was also very clever, and he quickly came up with a plan. He snuck outside and filled his pockets with pebbles. The next day, his father said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to the forest.&rdquo; So, off they went, one after the other in a long line, with the father leading and Little Thumb at the very end. Every five steps, he secretly dropped a pebble. When they reached a stream, the father stopped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cut wood on the other side. You stay here and play, and I&rsquo;ll come back to get you later.&rdquo;When the sun had set and the father still hadn&rsquo;t returned, the brothers began to cry. Little Thumb said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I know the way home.&rdquo; And he did, for he simply followed the pebbles he had dropped along the way.The father and mother were very happy to see them because that day the father had managed to sell some wood, and there was bread in the house once again.</p>
		<p>But after a while, things went wrong again. No one bought wood from the woodcutter, and once again, they all sat around the table with empty plates. So, the next day, the father took the children to the forest once more, and again, Little Thumb had filled his pockets with pebbles, which he dropped along the way. Once again, he found his way home in the evening. By chance, the father had earned a little money that day, and everyone was happy again.</p>
		<p>But even this happiness didn&rsquo;t last long. One day, there was only half a loaf of bread in the house, which was far too little for nine people. Little Thumb knew what he had to do, but when he tried to gather pebbles from the yard that night, he discovered to his dismay that the door was locked! The next day, the father divided the half loaf into seven pieces, one for each child, and led his sons into the forest once again. This time, instead of pebbles, Little Thumb dropped breadcrumbs every five steps. When it got dark, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think father is coming back. Let&rsquo;s head home; the breadcrumbs will show us the way.&rdquo; But guess what? Birds and mice had eaten the breadcrumbs. There they stood! How would they find their way home?</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here all night,&rdquo; said Little Thumb. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to find our own way back.&rdquo; But they got lost and wandered deeper into the forest, farther and farther from home. The brothers grew tired and started to blame Little Thumb, but he kept his spirits up. He climbed a tall tree, hoping to spot their house. Though he couldn&rsquo;t see it, he did see a light in the distance. Maybe they could find something to eat there because they were all starving! They reached a large, tall house, much bigger than their own. Little Thumb knocked on the door. A kind woman opened it. &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, do you have some food for us and perhaps a place to sleep?&rdquo; Little Thumb asked politely. &ldquo;Oh, poor children!&rdquo; said the woman, shocked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that a giant lives here, one who loves human flesh?&rdquo; She thought for a moment. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t send you back into the forest, it&rsquo;s completely dark now. You know what? There&rsquo;s an extra bed in the room next to where his seven daughters sleep. You can spend the night there. But you&rsquo;ll have to be very quiet because the giant must not know you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; She gave them each a bowl of soup. &ldquo;Eat quickly because the giant could return any moment!&rdquo; Hardly had she said this when the house began to shake. The woman jumped up and whispered urgently, &ldquo;The giant is coming back with his seven-league boots. With those magical boots, he can take strides as long as a football field. Quickly, upstairs!&rdquo; Tripping over each other, Little Thumb and his brothers hurried up the steep stairs, following the woman. She led them into a room. &ldquo;Get in bed, and remember: not a peep! His daughters are sleeping next door, and the giant mustn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo; She turned and went downstairs to let the giant in. Little Thumb and his brothers climbed into the large bed and held their breath. They heard the giant come in&mdash;or rather, they felt it, as the whole house shook. &ldquo;What do I smell?&rdquo; they heard him say. &ldquo;Do I smell human flesh?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; the woman replied nervously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining things.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Little Thumb quietly got out of bed and snuck over to the room where the giant&rsquo;s daughters were sleeping. They lay in one big bed, each wearing a small crown. Gently, Little Thumb took their crowns and crept back to his brothers. &ldquo;Put these crowns on!&rdquo; he whispered, and before hiding under the blanket, he put one on his own head.</p>
		<p>A bit later, the giant stomped up the stairs. &ldquo;And yet I smell human flesh,&rdquo; he muttered as he entered the room where Little Thumb and his brothers lay. In the dark, he felt the crowns and assumed they were his daughters. Still not completely sure, he went into the next room. &ldquo;See? I did smell human flesh,&rdquo; he said, feeling a head of hair and then, one by one, ate all his seven daughters, clothes and all, so quickly that they didn&rsquo;t even wake up! The giant flopped onto his bed, and soon he was snoring so loudly it sounded like a huge tree being felled.</p>
		<p>Little Thumb and his brothers quietly got out of bed and tiptoed down the stairs. In a corner of the kitchen lay the seven-league boots. Without hesitation, Little Thumb put them on, and, wonder of wonders, they fit perfectly! After all, they were magical boots. He grabbed his oldest brother&rsquo;s hand, who held the next brother&rsquo;s, and so on, and they strode in a line through the forest. When the sun rose, Little Thumb saw a house in the distance. &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;re home!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Their father and mother were overjoyed to see their children again, and to find that Little Thumb had cleverly brought back the seven golden crowns. They sold them, and from then on, they always had enough money for food. And never again did the father have to leave his children in the forest. Yes, that&rsquo;s how things go in fairy tales.</p>

		<p>A long, long time ago, there was an emperor who was incredibly vain. Now, everyone is a little vain, but this emperor loved looking in the mirror way too much&mdash;and, on top of that, he was quite foolish. Just listen.</p>
		<p>The emperor in this story did nothing but try on new clothes all day. In fact, he thought about nothing but clothes. He had twelve huge closets, all completely full, and mirrors were everywhere in his palace. Each hallway had at least three, the dining room had eight, and the grand salon had ten&mdash;let alone the bedroom. There was a giant mirror fastened to the ceiling so that he could look at himself even while lying in bed. As you can imagine, he spent a lot of time lying on his back.</p>
		<p>Everyone in the land talked about how vain the emperor was. Two strangers who happened to be traveling through the country and were out of money heard about this. They came up with a clever plan to make a lot of money easily.</p>
		<p>They went to the palace and told the emperor they could make clothes that were not only beautiful but also very special. The emperor sat up straight immediately&mdash;he had to have those clothes! &ldquo;How so, special?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Only smart people can see the clothes,&rdquo; explained the men. &ldquo;For foolish people, they&rsquo;re invisible.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>These clothes are not only beautiful and special, thought the emperor, but also very useful because now I&rsquo;ll know who is foolish and who isn&rsquo;t. And you can see that the emperor himself wasn&rsquo;t very bright because who would believe such a thing? The emperor ordered the two liars to start immediately, as in two weeks, there would be a grand parade through the city, and he wanted to lead it in his new clothes. He showed them to a large room where they could set up their looms. The two men asked the emperor for heaps of money to buy the finest, most luxurious, and therefore the most expensive threads. But they kept the money for themselves. They didn&rsquo;t buy anything. Day after day, they sat at the looms, pretending to string threads, pretending to weave, pretending to pull the finest fabrics off the looms, and pretending to make the most beautiful clothes from these fabrics. But there were no fabrics, there were no clothes&mdash;there was nothing at all.</p>
		<p>Of course, the emperor was very curious about how the clothes looked. He sent his chief minister to check. One of the men showed him in and pointed to the empty looms and the bare tables. &ldquo;Just look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you see how beautifully the fabric shines? And do you see how splendid the clothes on the table turned out?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The chief minister looked at the empty looms and the empty tables and thought, Oh dear, I must be foolish because I don&rsquo;t see any clothes. But he didn&rsquo;t say this out loud because he didn&rsquo;t want everyone to know he was foolish. So he said, &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes! They&rsquo;re truly magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And when the emperor later asked how the clothes were, the chief minister again said they were magnificent. &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; the emperor thought to himself. &ldquo;This minister isn&rsquo;t foolish, for he can see the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Everyone in the land heard about the two marvelous tailors, and everyone talked about the emperor&rsquo;s new clothes. The emperor grew more and more curious, but he had to wait until the day of the big parade. Only then would he finally be allowed to admire his new clothes.</p>
		<p>With all his ministers in a line behind him, he went to the room of the two fraudsters. Of course, the emperor couldn&rsquo;t see the clothes. Oh no, he thought, am I foolish too? And naturally, he didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know that either. &ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are truly stunning!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; said all the ministers, who also saw nothing. &ldquo;They are truly stunning!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The emperor then undressed completely to put on his new clothes. The two men pretended to dress him. First, they pretended to put on underwear, then a shirt, pants, a jacket, and the rest of the ensemble. Then they took a step back and looked at the naked emperor from head to toe. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the clothes truly suit you perfectly!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; all the ministers chimed in, &ldquo;the clothes truly suit you perfectly!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Proudly, the emperor walked outside and, stark naked, paraded confidently at the head of the procession. The streets were packed with people, all eager to see the emperor&rsquo;s new clothes, and everyone shouted, &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh, what magnificent clothes!&rdquo; Because no one wanted to appear foolish, of course.</p>
		<p>But suddenly, a little boy called out, &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t wearing any clothes at all!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Startled, the people around the boy looked at him. Then they looked at each other again. And you know what happens when one person dares to tell the truth? Suddenly, others dare to as well. So a moment later, everyone was shouting, &ldquo;The emperor is walking around naked! The emperor is walking around naked!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Clearly, I&rsquo;m not the only foolish one, thought the emperor. He straightened his back and marched even more proudly through the crowd. Completely naked! Can you imagine that?</p>

		<p>A long, long time ago, there was a mother goat who lived with her seven little kids in a cottage at the edge of the forest. Very often, three times a week even, Mother Goat had to go to the village to buy groceries, because seven little goats sure eat a lot! And every time before leaving, she would say, &ldquo;Listen well, children, be careful of the wolf! I don&rsquo;t need to tell you what wolves do to little goats. So lock the door tightly when I&rsquo;m gone. You must only open it for me and no one else. Do you understand?&rdquo; She was so careful! And she was right, just listen...</p>
		<p>One day, Mother Goat had to go shopping again. This time, someone was hiding behind the big tree next to the cottage, watching her until she disappeared around the bend. That &ldquo;someone&rdquo; crept up to the cottage, sniffed around the walls and the windows. You guessed it&mdash;it was the wolf! He knocked on the door and said in his sweetest voice, &ldquo;Open up, my dear little goats, it&rsquo;s your mother.&rdquo; Inside, the kids huddled together in fear and replied, &ldquo;No, no, you don&rsquo;t sound like our mother. Our mother doesn&rsquo;t have such a gruff voice!&rdquo; They squeezed closer together and shivered with fright. Oh, that&rsquo;s right, thought the wolf, I need to speak in a higher voice. He walked back to the big tree, waited a moment, then returned to the door.With a high-pitched voice, he said, &ldquo;Dear little goats, open up, it&rsquo;s your mother.&rdquo; It did sound like their mother, but just to be sure, the kids called out, &ldquo;Then show us your paw under the door!&rdquo; They gasped and shrank back when they saw a brown, furry paw through the crack under the door! &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; they cried, trembling with wide eyes, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not our mother! Our mother has white paws!&rdquo; Oh, that&rsquo;s right, thought the wolf. He went to his den and came back with a pot of flour. He dipped a paw in it and then said in a high voice, &ldquo;Dear little goats, open the door! It&rsquo;s your mother.&rdquo; The little goats all gathered by the door and called, &ldquo;Then show us your paw!&rdquo;</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>When they saw the white paw, they opened the door. And they should not have done that&hellip; The wolf sprang inside. The little goats screamed and scattered in every direction. One hid under the table, the second behind the cupboard, the third under the bed, the fourth in the laundry basket, the fifth behind the coat rack, the sixth behind a door, and the seventh in the grandfather clock&hellip; The wolf found them all and gobbled them up right away&mdash;all but one... The only one he missed was the seventh little kid hiding in the clock.</p>
		<p>Not long after, Mother Goat came back. From a distance, she saw that the door was wide open, and when she found the flour pot near the door and couldn&rsquo;t see her kids anywhere, she began to wail in despair. &ldquo;My little ones, my little ones,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;where are you?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The seventh little goat crept out of the clock and told her what had happened. &ldquo;One thing is certain,&rdquo; said Mother Goat, &ldquo;if he ate six of my kids, he must have a very full belly now, and with such a big belly, he won&rsquo;t get far.&rdquo; She took a pair of scissors and a sewing kit and went outside. Flour was scattered everywhere, so she could easily see where the wolf had gone. And sure enough, there he was, sleeping under a tree not too far away.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Look at that big belly of his,&rdquo; Mother Goat said to herself, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where my darlings are.&rdquo; She tiptoed closer and, very quickly, snipped open his belly. The little goats sprang out. Mother Goat filled the wolf&rsquo;s belly with big stones and sewed it up again nice and tight. Then, they all hid behind the trees.</p>
		<p>After a long while, the wolf woke up. I feel so strange in my belly, he thought, and I&rsquo;m so thirsty! He walked to a brook, which was very hard to do with all those stones in his belly, leaned over to drink, fell into the water, and drowned. Mother Goat and her seven little kids jumped up and down with joy&mdash;they were so happy that the wicked wolf was gone. Relieved, they all went home. They took the flour pot with them and made delicious pancakes from it.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time&mdash;long, long ago&mdash;there was a girl named Little Red Riding Hood. That wasn&rsquo;t her real name, but everyone called her that because she always wore a red hood on her head.</p>
		<p>One day, her mother said, &ldquo;Little Red Riding Hood, you need to go visit Grandma. She&rsquo;s sick, and I&rsquo;ve packed a basket with bread rolls, cookies, and a nice bottle of wine for her.&rdquo;Grandma lived in a small cottage in the middle of the forest near the big oak tree. It was quite far, but Little Red Riding Hood knew the way very well. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;walk briskly and don&rsquo;t stray from the path.&rdquo; Little Red Riding Hood promised and set off through the forest, walking at a steady pace.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, a big wolf poked his head out from between the trees. Little Red Riding Hood greeted him politely but kept walking briskly. &ldquo;Young lady, young lady,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;why the rush? Where are you going with that basket?&rdquo;&ldquo;To Grandma&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied Little Red Riding Hood. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sick.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Oh? And where does Grandma live?&rdquo; asked the wolf again.&ldquo;Near the big oak tree,&rdquo; said Little Red Riding Hood, &ldquo;but if you don&rsquo;t mind, I have to go now. Goodbye, Mr. Wolf!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The wolf walked alongside her and said, &ldquo;Oh, come on, don&rsquo;t you see what a beautiful day it is today? And look at all those lovely flowers. I&rsquo;m sure Grandma would be very happy if you brought her a bunch of flowers along with that basket of treats.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>What Little Red Riding Hood didn&rsquo;t know was that the wolf was very hungry, and she looked like a tasty snack to him. But the wolf was greedy. Now that he&rsquo;d heard about Grandma, he wanted both Little Red Riding Hood *and* her grandmother as snacks.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to leave the path,&rdquo; said Little Red Riding Hood.&ldquo;Oh, come now!&rdquo; said the wolf. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your Grandma, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And with that, he disappeared among the trees.Little Red Riding Hood paused. The wolf was right; those flowers were beautiful. She forgot her mother&rsquo;s advice and&hellip; wandered off the path.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the wolf dashed through the forest toward the big oak tree. He arrived at Grandma&rsquo;s cottage and stopped outside. &ldquo;Grandma,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Little Red Riding Hood. Will you open the door for me?&rdquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, dear,&rdquo; Grandma called back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in bed. Just pull the string, and the door will open by itself.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The wolf pulled the string, pushed the door open, leapt onto Grandma&rsquo;s bed, and swallowed her in one big gulp. Then he grabbed a nightgown from the closet, put on Grandma&rsquo;s sleeping cap, perched her glasses on his nose, and got under the covers. Now he looked just like Grandma. Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood was already on her way again, now carrying a big bunch of flowers.When she reached Grandma&rsquo;s cottage, she noticed something odd: the door was open. She went inside and walked straight to the bedroom.</p>
		<p>She stared at her Grandma in surprise; something looked a little strange about her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But Grandma, what big ears you have!&rdquo; she cried, astonished.The wolf answered in a high-pitched voice, &ldquo;All the better to hear you with, my dear.&rdquo;&ldquo;But Grandma,&rdquo; said Little Red Riding Hood again, &ldquo;what a big nose you have!&rdquo;&ldquo;All the better to smell you with, my child,&rdquo; replied the wolf. &ldquo;But Grandma, what big eyes you have!&rdquo; said Little Red Riding Hood, even more surprised. &ldquo;All the better to see you with, my dear,&rdquo; answered the wolf.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But Grandma, what a big mouth you have!&rdquo; Little Red Riding Hood was amazed. &ldquo;All the better to eat you with!&rdquo; cried the wolf, who by now was ravenously hungry. He sprang up and gobbled Little Red Riding Hood in one big bite, just as he had done with Grandma. Satisfied, he lay back down in bed, immediately fell asleep (that&rsquo;s what happens when you eat so much!), and started snoring very loudly.</p>
		<p>Now, Grandma had a good friend who was a hunter. That afternoon, he happened to walk past the cottage and heard the wolf&rsquo;s snoring. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Grandma snoring like that,&rdquo; the hunter said to himself. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s not right. And the door is open; that&rsquo;s not right, either.&rdquo; He went inside, saw a basket of treats with a bunch of flowers beside it, noticed a broken pair of glasses on the floor, and then saw the wolf in the bed. The hunter understood at once that the wolf had eaten Grandma. And that basket&mdash;I know that basket, thought the hunter. That&rsquo;s Little Red Riding Hood&rsquo;s. Without another thought, he pulled out his hunting knife and cut open the wolf&rsquo;s belly. Out stepped Grandma and Little Red Riding Hood. &ldquo;Oh, whew, it was so stuffy in there,&rdquo; they sighed in relief. &ldquo;Shhh!&rdquo; whispered the hunter. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to wake the wolf.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;He went outside, gathered three large stones, stuffed them into the wolf&rsquo;s belly, and sewed it back up. Then all three of them hid in the large wardrobe. Through a crack, they kept an eye on the wolf.</p>
		<p>After a while, the wolf woke up. &ldquo;Oof,&rdquo; he groaned, rubbing his belly, &ldquo;I feel a little queasy.&rdquo; (No wonder, with those big stones in his belly, but he didn&rsquo;t know that!) &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m so thirsty!&rdquo; The wolf dragged himself outside to the stream. He bent down to drink, but because of the heavy stones in his belly, he fell headfirst into the water and drowned.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; shouted Little Red Riding Hood, the hunter, and Grandma, who had seen it all happen.Grandma quickly went back under the covers because she still wasn&rsquo;t feeling well. The hunter and Little Red Riding Hood each grabbed a chair, and the three of them enjoyed the bread rolls, cookies, and wine that Little Red Riding Hood&rsquo;s mother had packed.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Mmmmmm!&rdquo; said Grandma. &ldquo;Your mother sure knows how to bake delicious cookies, Little Red Riding Hood!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The hunter and Little Red Riding Hood wanted to say something, too, but their mouths were full. And you know you&rsquo;re not supposed to talk with your mouth full&mdash;everyone knows that.</p>

		<p>ONCE upon a time, there was a king who had eleven daughters. Was he happy with them? Yes and no. Yes, because he was rather proud of all those beautiful girls. And no, because they gave him a headache. He was faced with a mystery. For weeks on end, he had to buy new shoes for his eleven daughters every single day. Eleven pairs of shoes each day, that&rsquo;s seventy-seven pairs of shoes in one week. And why? Because the shoes he bought the previous day were already worn out the next: the soles were falling off, the heels were worn down unevenly, the straps were torn, and so on. <br />How could this be? How could those shoes be completely worn out and destroyed in just one night? And it was even stranger because the king locked his daughters in their bedroom every evening precisely at eight o'clock. They couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere! <br /> <br />When he asked them about it, the eleven daughters would lower their eyes and stay silent in every language. The king was completely driven mad by this. And all those shoes also cost him a fortune. At his wit's end, the king placed an advertisement in the newspaper.</p>
		<p>Whoever could solve the mystery of the worn-out shoes would be allowed to marry one of the princesses. You could spend three nights in the girls' bedroom, but if you hadn&rsquo;t solved the mystery by then, your head would be chopped off. <br /> <br />Weeks went by. Many men had tried to solve the mystery, but each one of them fell asleep at some point and could not explain how those shoes became worn out. One soldier, who was no longer young and had been injured in the war, wanted to give it a try. But first, he went to a wise old woman for advice. The woman gave him a cloak that would make him invisible when he put it on. And she also gave him some wise advice: &ldquo;Above all, be careful not to drink anything!&rdquo; The soldier didn&rsquo;t entirely understand, but he decided to follow her advice anyway. <br /> <br />The next day, he knocked on the palace gate. The king let him in and said he hoped that the mystery would finally be solved. When the clock struck eight, the princesses went to bed. The soldier received the key to the bedroom and locked himself in with the princesses. He put the key in his pocket. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the girls were getting ready for the night. The youngest offered <br />the soldier a glass of red wine. &ldquo;You were injured, weren't you?&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;You must <br />need some strengthening. A good glass of wine will do you good!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The soldier was very thirsty and was just about to take a sip when he remembered <br />what the wise woman had said: &ldquo;Above all, be careful not to drink anything!&rdquo; So he secretly poured the <br />glass into a vase. Moments later, the youngest princess showed him to a nice soft bed. The soldier lay down and <br />closed his eyes. The magic cloak was rolled up beside him. <br /> <br />The light went out, and for a long time, nothing happened. The soldier decided to pretend to sleep and began to snore. And sure enough, the light came on again. He heard whispering and rustling all around. &ldquo;That old man would have fallen asleep even without our sleeping potion,&rdquo; joked one of the princesses. The soldier carefully opened one eye and saw that the girls were all taking ball gowns out of their wardrobes. They dressed up, made themselves look beautiful, and pinned pearls, ribbons, and flowers in their hair, and the jingling of bracelets and necklaces filled the air.</p>
		<p>When they were ready, the oldest princess tapped her bed, causing it to sink into the floor. The princesses one by one disappeared into the hole that had appeared. The soldier put on his magic cloak and followed them. They went down a staircase into a dark underground passage. The soldier, now invisible, couldn&rsquo;t see his own hand in front of his face, but he could hear the swishing of gowns and the excited whispering and giggling of the girls. One of them said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I have the feeling we&rsquo;re being followed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining it.&rdquo; The soldier could barely keep up with the girls. After a while, the passage opened into a magnificent orchard. The trees had silver leaves. In a second orchard, there were trees with golden leaves, and in a third, the trees had diamond leaves! In the bright moonlight, the princesses ran further towards a large lake. Eleven little boats waited there for them, each with a prince inside. The princesses got in. The soldier climbed into the youngest princess&rsquo;s boat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;today it&rsquo;s much harder to row than usual. I think I ate too much.&rdquo; On the other side, they climbed ashore and entered a grand castle. In a magnificent ballroom, music was playing, and they began to dance, the handsome princes and the beautiful princesses. Laughing and making jokes, they glided gracefully across the dance floor, their ball gowns swirling in every direction. <br /> <br />This went on for hours without a single break. As they danced, they refilled their glasses with champagne. Exactly at four o'clock, everything suddenly came to an end. Everyone rushed back to the boats. The princesses ran through the three orchards, dashed through the underground passage, climbed the stairs, and returned to the bedroom. The soldier had run ahead of them, so when the first princess climbed into the room, he was already lying in bed, supposedly snoring.The princesses hung their ball gowns back in the wardrobes. The soldier felt someone take the key out of his pocket. Soft footsteps sounded, the door opened and closed again, and the key was returned to his pocket. <br /> <br />The next morning, all the shoes lay in a pile outside the bedroom door. All of them were broken and worn out. Completely danced to pieces! The soldier now knew the secret. But he said nothing to the king, because he wanted to experience the strange adventure one more time. The second night was the same. The princesses again put on ball gowns, even more beautiful than the previous night, and set out again. In the underground passage, the soldier accidentally stepped on the youngest princess's train. She let out a startled cry and said, &ldquo;I have the feeling we&rsquo;re not alone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; the others called, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining it.&rdquo; <br /> <br />Outside, clouds swept across a dark sky, but in the castle, the chandeliers were lit, and they danced as if their lives depended on it, their faces flushed from the champagne and excitement. The soldier wanted to dance, too, and he took the youngest princess's hand. The girl gave a little scream. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone here!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; said the prince she was dancing with, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining it.&rdquo; When the party ended, the girls all ran back to their bedroom. <br /> <br />And the next morning, the king found yet another pile of worn-out shoes outside the bedroom door! Once again, the soldier said nothing to the king.</p>
		<p>The third night, a strong wind was blowing. In each orchard, the soldier broke off a small branch, and each time, the youngest princess looked around in alarm. &ldquo;Do you hear that? I&rsquo;m telling you, we&rsquo;re being followed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; the others called, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining it.&rdquo; In the ballroom, <br />the soldier picked up a silver cup and slipped it into his pocket. Just before dawn, everyone was in bed again. And the worn-out shoes lay in a pile outside the door. <br /> <br />The next day, when the king asked him if he had solved the mystery, the soldier told him everything. The princesses were brought in, and of course, they said the soldier was lying. But then the soldier produced a silver, a gold, and a diamond branch. And also a silver cup. The princesses burst into tears because they understood that their secret had been discovered. &ldquo;Now you may choose a princess,&rdquo; said the king. The soldier chose the youngest. He thought she was the most beautiful.She wasn&rsquo;t exactly thrilled, because she thought he was far too old. But alas, if you are a princess, you can&rsquo;t just marry whomever you want. No, your father chooses for you. <br /> <br />The princesses never danced again, or at least not night after night. They had been enchanted all along, and when the secret was discovered, the spell was broken. The people of the land were glad. They had to pay less tax from then on, because now that the king didn&rsquo;t need to buy eleven new pairs of shoes every day, there was plenty of money in the royal treasury.</p>

		<p>LONG, LONG AGO, there was once a miller who was very proud of his daughter. He thought she was the most beautiful, sweetest, and cleverest girl in the whole world. He boasted that she could do anything &ndash; whatever you could think of, she could do it.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Can she really do everything?&rdquo; someone once asked. &ldquo;Can she also spin gold from straw?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Of course, she can,&rdquo; said the miller without blinking an eye.</p>
		<p>He shouldn&rsquo;t have said that, because a) it wasn&rsquo;t true, and b) that person told the king. And this king was very greedy, especially when it came to gold. So, the girl had to come to the palace immediately.</p>
		<p>The king took her to a little room in the attic. Three bundles of straw lay on the floor, and there was a spinning wheel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if you haven&rsquo;t spun this straw into gold, I&rsquo;ll have your head chopped off.&rdquo; He left the room and locked the door behind him.</p>
		<p>The girl stayed behind in shock. She looked at the bundles of straw and burst into tears because, of course, she couldn&rsquo;t make gold from straw &ndash; who could, anyway?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>As tears streamed down her face, she suddenly heard a tiny voice say, &ldquo;Why are you crying, girl?&rdquo; In front of her stood a very small, dwarfish man.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If I haven&rsquo;t spun all this straw into gold by tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll be beheaded,&rdquo; sobbed the girl.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can help you,&rdquo; said the little man, &ldquo;for I can spin gold from straw. But as a reward, I want that necklace around your neck.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said the girl. She quickly took off her necklace and gave it to him.</p>
		<p>The little man put her to sleep, and when she awoke the next morning, she had to squint her eyes shut because the room was gleaming with gold!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The door opened, and the king entered. &ldquo;Well, well, girl,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;you did well!&rdquo; But did you think he was satisfied now? No! He had six more bundles of straw brought in and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow, and if this straw hasn&rsquo;t turned to gold, I&rsquo;ll have your head chopped off.&rdquo; And once again, he locked the door.</p>
		<p>The girl started crying again, and there was the dwarf again. This time, he wanted her bracelet. After he got it, he put her to sleep again and transformed the straw into gold.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But even with six piles of gold, the king wasn&rsquo;t satisfied. Now she was taken to a larger room, stuffed to the ceiling with straw.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Until tomorrow!&rdquo; he said to the girl. &ldquo;You know what happens if you don&rsquo;t spin it into gold. But if you succeed, you may marry the prince tomorrow.&rdquo; And after those words, he locked the door. The girl was desperate. What if the dwarf didn&rsquo;t come? But there he was again.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I have nothing left to give you,&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;You already took my necklace and bracelet.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>-----</p>
		<p>The little man thought for a moment. &ldquo;If I understand correctly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you get to marry the prince if I turn the straw into gold. Fine with me, but as a reward, I want your first child.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The girl was so frightened about losing her head that she didn&rsquo;t think twice and quickly said, &ldquo;Yes, yes, I promise!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The dwarf put her to sleep again, and the next day, all the straw was turned to gold.</p>
		<p>-----</p>
		<p>The miller&rsquo;s daughter married the prince, and after a while, a baby was born. The girl, now a princess, was overjoyed. But who should suddenly appear? The dwarf!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for my reward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>The girl began to cry terribly because she loved her child deeply, but that made no impression on the little man. &ldquo;A promise is a promise,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>The girl fell to her knees and offered him all the necklaces and bracelets she had if she could only keep the baby. The little man finally took pity on her and said, &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. If you can guess my name within three days, you can keep your child.&rdquo; And just as suddenly as he had come, he was gone again.</p>
		<p>The princess immediately asked all the footmen, maidservants, and ladies-in-waiting in the palace for their names and wrote them all down. The next day, when the dwarf came to the palace, the princess was ready with a long list of names. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the dwarf. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my name?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The princess started at the top of the list. &ldquo;Is your name Frederick?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the little man.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Is it Leopold?&rdquo; asked the princess.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
		<p>And so it went on. When she had read all the names, she still hadn&rsquo;t guessed the dwarf&rsquo;s name.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said the dwarf, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow!&rdquo; And off he went.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>Now all the palace servants had to go out and write down every name of everyone they met in the kingdom.</p>
		<p>The next day, the dwarf appeared again and said, &ldquo;Well? What&rsquo;s my name?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The princess now had twenty times as many names as the first time.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Is it Alfonso? Is it Arid? Is it Jojo? Is it Samson?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Each time, the little man replied, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And again, the princess hadn&rsquo;t guessed the name.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow is your last chance,&rdquo; warned the dwarf.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>The princess was at her wits&rsquo; end, for where could she possibly find more names? She wandered sadly through the park around the palace. When it grew dark and she was about to head home, she suddenly heard someone singing. Where was that coming from? In the distance, through the trees, she saw a fire burning with something small hopping around it. As she crept closer, she saw it was the dwarf! Silently, she hid behind a thick tree. And this is what the dwarf sang:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad, <br />oh, I&rsquo;m so glad, <br />that nobody knows <br />that my name is Rumpelstiltskin!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>You can imagine the princess slept well that night &ndash; for the first time in two days.</p>
		<p>The next day, the little man appeared, grinning.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is your last chance. What&rsquo;s my name?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The princess pretended to read from a long list of names and began: &ldquo;Are you&hellip; Dabberbeard?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the little man, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;no, that&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you perhaps&hellip; Froepeltroep?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No, no, ha-ha, no, no!&rdquo; The little man walked toward the crib.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then maybe&hellip; Rumpelstiltskin?&rdquo; The little man first looked at her in astonishment, then disappointment, and then very angrily. He was so angry that he burst apart!</p>
		<p>That was terrible for the little man, but the princess was thrilled. She took her baby from the crib and danced around the room.</p>
		<p>-----</p>
		<p>That afternoon, the prince, who had noticed none of the drama, came in. &ldquo;We still need to choose a name for our son,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>The girl took out a stack of paper from the drawer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already collected many names. We can choose from these.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The prince kissed her and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I find so special about you, you always think of everything.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And so, the miller&rsquo;s daughter lived happily ever after with her prince and her baby.</p>

		<p>LONG, LONG AGO, there was a woman who had two daughters. One was blonde, the other had black hair, and for reasons unknown to me, she loved the blonde daughter very much and disliked the other. This was despite the fact that the blonde girl was terribly lazy and grumpy, while the dark-haired girl was sweet and kind!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The lazy girl was spoiled; she could lie on the couch all day. The dark-haired daughter, on the other hand, had to work from early morning until late at night. And there was plenty to do: scrubbing the floors, cleaning the windows, and polishing pots, pans, spoons, knives, and forks until they shone like the sun.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, the dark-haired girl was polishing the cutlery again. To her dismay, a little spoon slipped from her hands and fell into the well. The mother became furious. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get that thing back!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how!&rdquo; And she went back to her embroidery.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The poor girl, who was terrified of her mother, tightly shut her eyes and jumped into the deep well. She fell and fell, and she kept falling, and during that fall, she, believe it or not, fell asleep!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she woke up, she was in a park. There were neatly raked flower beds and perfectly straight trees everywhere. Somewhere, she heard a soft voice calling: &ldquo;Get us out, get us out.&rdquo; Curious, the girl looked around. Behind her stood a little oven. Inside were rolls that cried out: &ldquo;Get us out, get us out! We&rsquo;re burning!&rdquo; Quickly, the girl took the rolls out of the oven and neatly placed them on a table.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you, girl, you won&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; said the rolls gratefully.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the girl cheerfully and walked on.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>A little later, she came to an apple tree that was sighing heavily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all bent over; I have so many ripe apples hanging on me. I wish someone would pick them.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Quickly, the girl picked all the apples.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you, girl,&rdquo; said the apple tree, which now stood up straight. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the girl and continued on her way.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>She walked under an archway and came to a little house. In front of the house stood an old woman. &ldquo;I am Mother Holle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve twisted my ankle, and now I can&rsquo;t clean my house. Would you come work for me? I will reward you well.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Of course, the girl wanted to help her, and she was used to working. But the old woman had a special request. She had to shake the pillows of the beds well because when she did that, it snowed on the people down on earth.</p>
		<p>The girl immediately took the broom and, singing, cleaned the little house from top to bottom. She shook the pillows as if her life depended on it, and feathers flew around.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; said the people on earth, &ldquo;what a snowstorm we&rsquo;re having!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>One day, the old woman said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for you to go home. I&rsquo;ve seen that you&rsquo;re a nice girl who loves to help everyone, so I will reward you well. Just walk under that archway. And here&rsquo;s your little spoon back.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>As the girl walked under the archway, gold rained down on her. She was completely covered in it.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she got home, her mother gasped in surprise.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How did you get all that gold?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The girl told her about the rolls, the apple tree, and Mother Holle. The mother, who was crazy about gold, quickly went to her favorite daughter and said, &ldquo;You should jump into the well too, then you&rsquo;ll get gold as well.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The blonde girl didn&rsquo;t want to do that at all, but her mother pulled her off the couch, threw a spoon into the well, and pushed her daughter in after it. She too fell asleep during the fall, woke up in the park, and heard the rolls begging to be taken out of the oven.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But the girl replied sharply, &ldquo;And my fingers are burning, I have better things to do.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>She walked on and snapped at the apple tree, &ldquo;I have no desire to pick all those apples. You do it yourself.&rdquo; She walked under the archway and came to Mother Holle.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The blonde girl was also asked by Mother Holle if she could help with the housework, especially to shake the pillows well. The girl, of course, didn&rsquo;t want to do that at all, but she thought of the gold and said yes. But even with Mother Holle, she spent the whole day on the couch and did nothing. She didn&rsquo;t sweep the floors or clean the pots. The little house became increasingly dirty, and she only half-heartedly shook the pillows.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What miserable snow this is!&rdquo; said the people on earth.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After three days, the girl had had enough and told Mother Holle that she wanted to go home. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Mother Holle. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your spoon back, and just walk under the archway, and you will receive your reward.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But what fell on her was not gold, no, it was pitch! Thick, black, sticky, gooey, gluey strands of pitch!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she got home, her mother gasped in shock. She no longer recognized her own daughter. And no matter what they did, how they tried, the pitch wouldn&rsquo;t come off!Well, you see, that&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re lazy and unkind.</p>

		<p>LONG, LONG AGO, there was a farmer. He was a very good man who harmed no one, but he wasn&rsquo;t very clever. No matter how hard he worked, he remained very poor. His vegetables withered in the garden, his only sheep fell ill and died, and all that he had left was a cow.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, there was no food left in the house. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;but we must sell the cow. Then we can at least buy some food.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next morning, the farmer took the cow to the market. On the way, on a quiet path, a man walked beside him. The farmer immediately felt very uneasy because it seemed as though the man was walking, but when you looked closely, you could see he was hovering a little above the ground.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This must be a wizard,&rdquo; the farmer said to himself, and he walked a bit faster, but the man stayed close to him.</p>
		<p>After a while, the man said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to the market to sell your cow because you have no food left for your wife and children.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer was startled. Now he was sure: this was indeed a wizard!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; he asked in a tiny voice.</p>
		<p>In response, the strange man pulled a bottle out of his pocket. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you give me that cow, I will give you this bottle.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A bottle? But a cow is worth much more than a bottle!&rdquo; said the farmer, for he wasn&rsquo;t that stupid.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but this is no ordinary bottle. It&rsquo;s a magic bottle.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>You see, thought the farmer, a magic bottle! So it is indeed a wizard!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; the man continued. &ldquo;You sell that cow at the market, you get some money for it, and after a few days, the money will be gone. Then you&rsquo;ll be back where you started. With this bottle, you will have much longer enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But my wife will surely be very angry if I come home with a bottle,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so too,&rdquo; said the strange man. &ldquo;But if she starts nagging, just tell her to sweep the floor, set a tablecloth on the table, and place the bottle in the middle of the table. Then you&rsquo;ll see something. Just believe me. You&rsquo;re a good man, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing this for you.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer suddenly became very scared. Imagine if he was going to cast a spell on me if I didn&rsquo;t do what he wanted, he thought. So he quickly said, &ldquo;Alright, give me the bottle.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And so the man got the cow, and the farmer got the bottle. And yes, of course! At home, the wife began to rage and scream. She called him all sorts of ugly names. What good was an empty bottle?</p>
		<p>The man looked dejectedly at his shoes and softly said that she should sweep the floor, put a tablecloth on the table, and place the bottle in the middle of the table. Just as the man had told him.</p>
		<p>The wife raised her hands to heaven. &ldquo;Man, how can you be so stupid! Sweep the floor, lay a tablecloth, and then what? We still have no food?!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While shouting, she swept the floor, laid a tablecloth, and placed the bottle in the middle of the table.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And what happened then&hellip;</p>
		<p>They couldn&rsquo;t believe their eyes. Two little men climbed out of the bottle and set plates full of goodies on the table. And when they were done, they disappeared back into the bottle. The woman called the children, and they all ate their fill. Afterward, they waited in suspense to see if the little men would take the plates away. But that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
		<p>You can imagine that they now put the bottle on the table all the time because they had never eaten so well. They ate the most delicious things five times a day and began to look healthy.</p>
		<p>And they had another advantage: they now had cupboards full of plates. They sold those at the market and made a lot of money from them. The whole family walked around in the finest clothes, and they moved to a large farm with many cows, sheep, and horses.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>A rich man, who also lived in the village, visited the farmer and asked how it came to be that he was now so rich. The farmer told him all about the magic bottle.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;May I borrow it for a day?&rdquo; asked the rich man.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, with pleasure,&rdquo; said the farmer, who might not have been smart, but was very kind.</p>
		<p>The rich man took the bottle and quickly returned to his house. He told his wife to sweep the floor and lay a tablecloth, then placed the bottle in the middle. Out came the two little men with plates full of pastries, roasted turkey legs, puddings, and fries. Now this was nothing special for the rich man and his wife. They ate pudding or cake or turkey every day. But this they got for free, without paying for it. So the rich man wanted to have the bottle.</p>
		<p>The next day, he took a regular bottle from the cellar, which looked exactly like the magic bottle. He gave it to the farmer and said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your bottle back. I believe it has lost its magic power because it didn&rsquo;t do anything at all.&rdquo; When the rich man left, the farmer swept the floor, laid a tablecloth, and placed the bottle in the middle of the table. And indeed&hellip; nothing happened.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;we had a lot of fun with it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>In the next part of the story, you&rsquo;ll hear that the farmer really wasn&rsquo;t very clever.</p>
		<p>He had become accustomed to buying everything he wanted, and now that he could no longer do that, he didn&rsquo;t know what to do. So he first sold the fine clothes, then the nice furniture, and finally the large farm. He became poorer and poorer, and after a while, they lived in a little hut and only had one cow left.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer saw only one solution. I&rsquo;ll sell the cow at the market, he thought, and maybe I&rsquo;ll run into that wizard again on the way.</p>
		<p>He took the same path, and&hellip; lo and behold, there he was, exactly in the same place.</p>
		<p>The wizard pulled another bottle out from under his cloak and asked, &ldquo;Your cow for this bottle?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The farmer immediately said yes, and while he was already running home, the wizard called after him, &ldquo;My bottles never lose their magic!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At home, the farmer swept the floor, laid a tablecloth on the table, and placed the bottle in the middle.</p>
		<p>But now, out came not two little men from the bottle, but two big guys with clubs, and they beat the farmer and his wife so badly that it was no longer pretty.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a while, they disappeared back into the bottle.</p>
		<p>The farmer and his wife lay groaning on the floor. The wife felt a bump on her forehead and moaned, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that the wizard said his bottles never lose their magic? Well then, that rich man tricked you!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer took the second bottle to the rich man, who now lived in a beautiful, palace-like house, and knocked on the door. A servant opened it. The farmer asked if he could speak to the rich man. But the rich man had him chased off the property.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it! Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; cried the farmer. &ldquo;Tell your master that I have a bottle for him again.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The rich man heard this and immediately came to the door, patted the farmer warmly on the shoulder, and let him in. His wife swept the floor, laid a tablecloth, and the farmer placed the bottle in the middle of the table. They waited anxiously, and yes! Out came the two big men and beat the rich man and his wife black and blue.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Make them stop!&rdquo; cried the rich man. &ldquo;Ouch, ouch! Make them stop!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Only if I get my magic bottle back,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
		<p>The rich man pointed to a cupboard. &ldquo;There, on the top shelf! Take it away, take it away! Ouch! Ouch!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer could now buy all sorts of things again. But he had become wiser. He no longer bought everything indiscriminately but learned how to grow vegetables and keep sheep and cows healthy. So after a while, he no longer needed the bottle at all and was able to earn his own bread.</p>

			<p>Once upon a time, there was a woodcutter and his wife, and their two children, Hans and Grietje. They were so poor that they were always hungry. One day, the mother had had enough. &ldquo;We have no food left for the children,&rdquo; she said to her husband. &ldquo;I can't bear to see them hungry anymore. Tomorrow, you will take them to the forest and leave them there.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>So, it was decided. The next morning, the father took the children into the woods. He stopped at a clearing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to chop wood a bit further away,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you will stay here until I come back.&rdquo; He left the last piece of dry bread he had with the children, of course.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The sun set, and Hans and Grietje began to feel cold. Their father still did not show up. &ldquo;He might have forgotten us,&rdquo; said Hans, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s okay, because I know the way home.&rdquo; He took his sister by the hand.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>But under the tall trees, it was very dark, and they got lost. They wandered further away from home all night&mdash; with grumbling stomachs, I can tell you, because one piece of dry bread for an entire day and half a night is not much.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Suddenly, Hans saw a house in the distance. It was a very special house. The walls were made of cookies, and the roof was made of marzipan. Grietje broke off a piece of the roof and was just about to put it in her mouth when a trembling voice came from inside the house:</p>
			<p>**Nibble, nibble, nibble,**<br />**who's nibbling at my house?**</p>
			<p>Startled, Grietje replied, <br />**"It's the wind, it's the wind,** <br />**that finds the house so nice."**</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The door of the house creaked open, and an old woman stumbled out. &ldquo;Are you eating from my house?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Are you so hungry, children?&rdquo; She shook her head sympathetically. &ldquo;But cookies aren't real food! Come inside, and I&rsquo;ll give you a hearty bowl of soup.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>It was warm inside. They finished the soup in no time, and after all that walking, they were so tired that they nearly fell asleep over their bowls. The kind old lady tucked them into bed under a soft, woolen blanket.</p>
			<p>The next day, before dawn, the old woman shook them awake. She was suddenly no longer kind and friendly. And she wasn&rsquo;t stumbling either; it turned out she was very strong. She dragged Hans out of bed and locked him in a cage, throwing the key up on a shelf.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she said to Grietje, pushing her against the wall, &ldquo;you will clean this house. You will work until you drop. You didn't think you could eat from my house without consequences, did you?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The old woman was actually a wicked witch; you may have guessed that already. Grietje had to do all the housework. The only thing she didn&rsquo;t have to do was cook because the witch did that herself. And not just any cooking; she prepared the most delicious meals. The strange thing was, she never ate any of it. Grietje only got crusts of bread. No, all the treats were for Hans. That was how it went the first day and all the days after.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>After a few weeks, the witch said one evening to Hans, &ldquo;Stick your finger through the bars!&rdquo; She felt it and mumbled, &ldquo;Not fat enough, not fat enough.&rdquo; Grietje heard that and, while the witch was sleeping, she quietly crept to Hans in his cage.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I believe the witch is fattening you up,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;She wants you to get very fat because she plans to eat you. If she asks you to stick out your finger again, you must stick this through the bars.&rdquo; And she gave him a thin, gnawed chicken bone. Then she quickly crawled back into bed.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>A few days later, the witch said again to Hans, &ldquo;Stick your finger out.&rdquo; Hans stuck the chicken bone through the bars. Luckily, the witch had bad eyesight, so she thought it was Hans&rsquo;s finger. She felt the bone, shook her head, and mumbled again, &ldquo;Not fat enough, not fat enough.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>----</p>
			<p>But after a while, the witch grew impatient. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. I cook the tastiest dishes for him, and he just won&rsquo;t get fat. And I am getting so hungry for little boy meat. You know what? I won't wait any longer; I will eat him today.</p>
			<p>A skinny little boy can also be delicious if you prepare him well.&rdquo; She already lit the oven and looked in her cookbook to see how to roast a little boy. &ldquo;Grietje,&rdquo; she called out, &ldquo;check if the oven is hot enough.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Grietje had long understood what the witch was planning, and she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to do that.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You know nothing,&rdquo; grumbled the witch, &ldquo;I will show you.&rdquo; She opened the oven door, stuck her head inside, and snapped, &ldquo;This is how you do it, you silly goose!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Now you can say what you want about Grietje, but she was not a silly goose. She immediately knew what to do. She pushed the witch all the way into the oven and quickly shut the door. The witch screamed for her life, but Grietje didn&rsquo;t pay attention. She pulled a chair to the tall cupboard to grab the key from the cage and quickly freed Hans.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Together, they searched the house, and do you know what they found? Gold coins! Gold coins and gemstones! Drawers and cupboards, everything was full of gold and gemstones. That wicked witch was, in fact, stinking rich!</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Hans and Grietje didn&rsquo;t think long about it. They stuffed as many of those gold coins and gemstones into their pockets as possible and ran into the woods, far away from the cookie-and-marzipan house. They didn&rsquo;t even dare to look back. They kept running, so scared that the witch would come after them. After all, you never know with witches. But eventually, they couldn&rsquo;t run anymore and collapsed, panting, onto the moss. Just when they thought they would never get home again, Hans suddenly saw where they were. &ldquo;Grietje,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think this path leads to our house.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>And he was right! Moments later, they knocked on the door of their house. Their father and mother were very happy to see their children again because they deeply regretted what they had done. They sold the gold and gemstones, and then they had enough money to buy bread, enough for a thousand years!</p>

		<p>A LONG, LONG time ago, in a place far away, there was a miller who had three sons. &ldquo;When I die,&rdquo; he always said, &ldquo;my oldest son shall have the mill, the second my donkey, and the third my cat.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So when the man was dead and buried, the oldest son moved into the mill, the second son received the donkey, and the youngest son got the cat.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, this is something,&rdquo; said the youngest son to himself. &ldquo;My oldest brother can earn money with the mill, my second brother can earn money with the donkey, but how am I supposed to earn money with a cat?&rdquo; He sighed deeply and looked sadly ahead. The cat walked over to him on its soft paws and, to the boy's great astonishment, began to speak! &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the cat, &ldquo;that you can&rsquo;t earn money with me, but believe it or not, I can make you rich.&rdquo; Of course, the boy didn&rsquo;t believe him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;First, buy me a nice pair of boots,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>What does a cat with four legs need with a pair of boots? thought the boy. But he can talk, so who knows what else he can do? With his last coins, he bought a pair of boots.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The cat stood up on his hind legs, put on the boots, and looked at himself in the mirror. He took a few steps to the left and a few steps to the right, nodded approvingly, put his owner&rsquo;s hat on his head, and walked out the door to carry out his plan. Because he had a plan! A plan to make his master the richest man in the land.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>He headed towards the river, where he caught two fat carp. With them, he went to the king&rsquo;s palace. To one of the attendants, he said, &ldquo;Tell the king that these carp are a gift from the Marquis of Carabas.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, the cat caught two partridges. Again he went to the king&rsquo;s palace. &ldquo;Give these to the king,&rdquo; said the cat to the attendant, &ldquo;and say that it&rsquo;s a gift from the Marquis of Carabas.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The king says he wants to speak to you himself,&rdquo; said the attendant, and he brought the cat to the king.</p>
		<p>The king greeted the cat warmly: &ldquo;Well, well, another gift from the Marquis of Carabas. He must be a very nice man. Would you please send him my regards and thank him warmly?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Not long after, the cat heard that the king, along with his daughter, the princess, would take a carriage ride along the lake.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The cat hurried to his master. &ldquo;Get dressed quickly; we&rsquo;re going to the lake.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Once there, they hid behind some bushes. &ldquo;If you want to become rich, do exactly as I say,&rdquo; whispered the cat. The miller&rsquo;s son didn&rsquo;t understand anything, but he nodded obediently. After all, he wanted to be rich!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a while, they heard the sound of hoofbeats: the king&rsquo;s carriage was approaching. &ldquo;Quick, jump into the water, now!&rdquo; whispered the cat, and he ran out onto the road, waving his paws wildly. &ldquo;Help, help!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The Marquis of Carabas is drowning, the Marquis of Carabas is drowning! Help, help!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The king ordered the carriage to stop and said, &ldquo;The Marquis of Carabas? Isn&rsquo;t that the nice gentleman who gave me those carp and partridges? We must help him immediately.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The miller&rsquo;s son was pulled from the water and given dry clothes. But that was not all. He was allowed to ride in the coach and sat next to the princess.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The cat did not wait for any of this and had already run ahead. When he reached the sprawling wheat fields, he asked the farmers working there, &ldquo;Whose wheat fields are these?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They belong to the great wizard who lives in the castle beyond the forest,&rdquo; one of the farmers replied, pointing into the distance.</p>
		<p>The cat said, &ldquo;The king will come by soon. If he asks whose wheat fields these are, you must say, &lsquo;They belong to the Marquis of Carabas.&rsquo; If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll bite your head off.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The farmers were a little afraid of a talking cat that walked upright like a person and wore boots, so they promised to do as he said. And off went the cat again.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Soon after, the king&rsquo;s carriage arrived at the wheat fields, and indeed, the king asked the farmers whose beautiful fields they were.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They belong to the Marquis of Carabas,&rdquo; they said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the king, looking at the miller&rsquo;s son in surprise. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said again, and the princess smiled kindly at him.</p>
		<p>The miller&rsquo;s son was, of course, as surprised as the king, but he said nothing.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the cat had arrived at the great forest and asked the ranger working there, &ldquo;Whose forest is this?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It belongs to the great wizard who lives in the castle, beyond that hill,&rdquo; replied the ranger.</p>
		<p>The cat said, &ldquo;The king will come by soon. If he asks whose forest this is, you must say, &lsquo;It belongs to the Marquis of Carabas.&rsquo; And if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll bite your head off.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The ranger was a bit afraid of a cat in boots, so he promised to say that. And the cat ran on.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then the king&rsquo;s carriage arrived at the forest. The king leaned out of the window and asked the ranger whose forest it was.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It belongs to the Marquis of Carabas,&rdquo; said the ranger.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said the king, nodding kindly at the miller&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Well, well, well.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The princess smiled and moved a little closer to the boy.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the cat continued running, and now he arrived at the wizard&rsquo;s castle. It was an enormous castle, twice as large and beautiful as the king&rsquo;s. Now, this wizard was a very nasty man. No one dared to go near his castle, for everyone could tell you that he had once turned a hundred people into worms&mdash;just like that, because he was in a bad mood. But the booted cat was not afraid at all; he simply walked right in. Clack, clack went the boots on the shiny marble floor, and the wizard, who was sitting behind a large table, looked up in surprise.</p>
		<p>The cat made a deep bow. &ldquo;Oh, great wizard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everyone says you are a very powerful sorcerer, but you know, people say so much.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t believe that?&rdquo; said the wizard. &ldquo;Well, just watch!&rdquo; No sooner had he said that than he vanished, and in the wizard&rsquo;s place stood a great roaring lion, which tried to crush the cat with its claws. But the cat had expected something like this and quickly ran away, into the curtains.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, wonderful!&rdquo; cried the cat from above. &ldquo;You truly can work magic. But can you also turn yourself into something small? A mouse, for example?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At that very moment, the lion disappeared, and a little mouse scurried across the floor squeaking.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; said the cat, and in one leap, he was down and gobbled up the mouse, fur and all.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The royal coach had now arrived at the castle. The king leaned out of the window to see whom he could ask whose beautiful castle this was. To his surprise, the booted cat came outside.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Your royal highness,&rdquo; said the cat with a deep bow, &ldquo;welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said the king, looking at the miller&rsquo;s son with admiration.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said the princess, extending her hand to the miller&rsquo;s son, who helped her out of the coach. Together they walked into the castle. Everyone was amazed&mdash;especially the miller&rsquo;s son! What splendor and riches: marble and gold everywhere!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Your castle is even more beautiful and larger than mine,&rdquo; said the king to the miller&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;I happen to be looking for a man for my daughter,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I think you would be very suitable for that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The princess nodded three, four times in succession, for she thought so too.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Soon a wedding was celebrated, and the bride and groom moved into the magnificent castle.</p>
		<p>And the cat? He got his own room and twenty attendants who did nothing all day but take care of him. He also received a wardrobe full of boots, in all the colors of the rainbow.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Everything was now rosy and bright, except that the princess could never understand why her husband spoiled that cat so much. Twenty attendants, she thought that was really excessive!</p>
		<p>But, well, he couldn&rsquo;t explain it to her.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter who lived with his wife in a very small, dilapidated hut. No matter how hard he worked or how much wood he chopped, it didn&rsquo;t help. They remained just as poor.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>In front of their little house, they had a small vegetable garden, so they always had some vegetables. And sometimes, when the man earned a little extra, his wife would buy a nice piece of fatty bacon.</p>
		<p>One morning, the man got up at dawn and went into the woods to chop wood again. He had some carrots from the vegetable garden in his bag, which would be his lunch. As he was walking home late in the afternoon, he suddenly heard a faint voice halfway, as if it came from very far away. That was strange, because no one ever came to this part of the forest. The man thought for a moment that he might have imagined it, but no, he heard it again, a weak cry: "Help! Help!"</p>
		<p>The man looked around. No one was in sight. He was about to continue walking when he saw something moving under a fallen branch. It was a tiny little man wildly waving his arms. "Help! Help!"</p>
		<p>"I'm coming!" said the woodcutter, quickly removing the branch.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The little man jumped up and dusted off his clothes. "I was looking for mushrooms," he said, "and then the wind blew and this branch hit me on the head. You have saved my life! As a reward, you may make three wishes, and I will grant them all."</p>
		<p>"Three wishes?" asked the man in disbelief. "Can you really grant wishes?"</p>
		<p>"Of course," replied the little man, "but I warn you: think carefully before you wish for something because wishing is harder than you think!"</p>
		<p>"Can I wish for whatever I want?" asked the woodcutter, still skeptical. "Anything at all?"</p>
		<p>"Everything that comes to your mind," said the little man. He waved goodbye to the woodcutter and disappeared among the ferns.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"How can wishing be difficult?" the man thought to himself. "I could think of a hundred wishes in a row: a roasted chicken, a nice fluffy pudding, a delicious warm donut with lots of powdered sugar, pea soup with a pig's trotter&hellip; Mmmm, I&rsquo;m already salivating." He ran home and shouted from afar, "Wife, wife, you won't believe what happened to me!"</p>
		<p>His wife was in the kitchen preparing their meager dinner. "What is it?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"I get to make three wishes," said the man, out of breath, "and they will all come true immediately!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Stumbling over his words, the woodcutter told her everything about the little man. "And now I can wish for anything I want. Anything is allowed."</p>
		<p>"He must be joking," said the wife, as she dished out some potatoes and a boiled onion onto his plate.</p>
		<p>The man, who had dreamed of puddings and donuts all the way home, looked regretfully at the potatoes and the onion. "I wish there was a nice thick sausage to go with it," he said, and scarcely had he spoken when there lay the sausage steaming on his plate, right next to the potatoes and onion!</p>
		<p>"Look, wife, there&rsquo;s a real sausage!" exclaimed the woodcutter in astonishment. "That little man wasn&rsquo;t joking at all!"</p>
		<p>"Fool!" said his wife. "Look what you've done! Instead of nice clothes or a lot of money, you wished for something as silly as a sausage!"</p>
		<p>"I said it without thinking," the man replied, alarmed.</p>
		<p>"I've never seen anything so foolish!" lamented the wife. "Foolish beyond measure! A sausage!"</p>
		<p>"I do like sausages..." the man stuttered.</p>
		<p>"What does that have to do with anything!" shrieked the wife. "A golden axe for you, diamond earrings for me, a beautiful house, or just a lot of money would have been better than a sausage!"</p>
		<p>"We still have two wishes left," said the man, "so..."</p>
		<p>"So-so-so," shouted the wife, "you and your so! You really messed up the first wish! I've never seen such a dimwit!" And she continued to rant.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"Stop shouting!" the man yelled. "What are you so worked up about over a sausage? I wish that silly sausage would hang from your silly nose!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And there hung the sausage from the woman&rsquo;s nose... For a moment, there was dead silence in the room. Then the woman started pulling hard on the sausage, but it wouldn&rsquo;t come off. The man grabbed a knife and tried to cut the sausage off her nose, but that didn&rsquo;t work either. Defeated, they looked at each other. The woman began to cry. There they sat, and now what? The man put his arm around her shoulders.</p>
		<p>"Now I have to go through life with that sausage hanging from my nose," she sobbed. "Everyone will laugh at me!"</p>
		<p>Then the man stood in the middle of the room and shouted loudly and clearly: "I still have a third wish, and I wish for the sausage to fall off your nose!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And it happened. Relieved, they embraced each other, and then they danced around the room. They sat back at the table, neatly divided the sausage in two, and happily finished their plates. Then they went to bed, very satisfied, because no one wants to go through life with a sausage on their nose.</p>
		<p>But yes, they were still just as poor...</p>

		<p>Long, long ago, there lived a king and a queen who had a little daughter. They were very happy about it. The flags were raised, and they threw a grand celebration. They knew thirteen fairies and wanted to invite them all, but the unfortunate thing was that they only had twelve golden plates. Well, they thought, let&rsquo;s just invite twelve of them. The thirteenth fairy surely wouldn&rsquo;t mind. Well, they thought wrong. The thirteenth fairy felt greatly insulted. She was furious, and she wasn&rsquo;t entirely wrong, just think about it!</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>When the feast was in full swing, the fairies took turns coming forward to pronounce their wishes for the child. The first fairy came up and said, "The princess will be very beautiful." The second fairy stepped forward and said, "The princess will be very sweet." The next fairy said, "The princess will be very happy."</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>This continued until eleven fairies had wished something beautiful for the princess. Just as the twelfth fairy was about to step forward, she was pushed aside. And do you know by whom? By the angry thirteenth fairy, who had not been invited. She suddenly stood in the banquet hall. No one had seen her come in, and she was furious!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, my wish!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;And I say: when she turns fifteen, the princess will prick herself on a spinning wheel! And she will fall dead next to the spinning wheel!&rdquo; And off she went.</p>
		<p>Everyone stood frozen in shock. Luckily, the twelfth fairy had not yet spoken her wish. &ldquo;I cannot completely undo the wish of the thirteenth fairy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I can make it less severe. The princess will prick herself on a spinning wheel, unfortunately, that cannot be changed. But she will not die; no, she will fall asleep and will remain asleep for one hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One hundred years of sleep! The king and queen were very sad, which you can understand. One hundred years is a long time! But well, it was still better than falling dead.</p>
		<p>The king and queen could think of nothing else. &ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Everyone in the kingdom must burn their spinning wheels. If there are no spinning wheels, the princess cannot prick herself on one.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So they did just that. The very next day, there was not a single spinning wheel to be found in the entire kingdom. The princess grew up, and all the wishes of the twelve fairies came true. She became a beautiful and sweet girl who meant no harm, and everyone truly loved her.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she turned fifteen, her parents remembered what the thirteenth fairy had said. All the spinning wheels had been burned, so the princess was not in danger, but still, the parents were cautious. They decided not to hold a birthday party, for you never know with so many guests. However, the princess did get a day off. She didn&rsquo;t have to attend lessons or do homework that day.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The girl was a bit bored. She wandered through the palace gardens and hallways. She looked into rooms she had never been in&mdash;such was the size of the palace! While strolling, she found herself in the royal attic. There she saw a small door that was slightly ajar. She pushed it open and entered a small room. By the window sat an old woman, and beside her stood something the princess had never seen before.</p>
		<p>Curious, she pointed to it. &ldquo;Dear lady, what is that thing?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The old woman looked up from her work. &ldquo;Dear princess, this is a spinning wheel,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;Come closer, you may touch it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And hardly had the princess touched the spinning wheel when she pricked herself on something. And as the twelfth fairy had foretold, she sank to the ground and fell into a hundred-year sleep.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; laughed the old woman, for&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;she was, of course, the thirteenth fairy who had transformed herself into a sweet old woman!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The strange thing was that not only did the princess fall asleep, but everyone in the palace did too. The cook was just about to give his helper a slap and fell asleep with his hand still in the air. A lady-in-waiting was about to hang a dress in a wardrobe and now slept with the dress in her hands. Even the dogs and the chickens fell asleep.</p>
		<p>The gardener was just trimming a rose bush when he fell asleep. So the bush grew and grew. It grew against the palace walls. It grew all the way over them, and after a few months, nothing of the palace could be seen.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Many years later, only a few old people could still tell that under that enormous rose bush, there was a palace with a sleeping princess inside. The people only half-believed it, but they did give her a name: Princess Sleeping Beauty. There were many princes who tried to chop down the bush to find the princess, but all the branches that were cut off grew back immediately. It was impossible.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When those hundred years finally passed, a prince happened to ride through this region on his white horse. He saw the rose bush, which was now as high as a mountain. &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this,&rdquo; he said to his horse, for that was his best friend. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see if those old stories are true. Is it really true that beneath all those roses lies a beautiful princess sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>He got off his horse, drew his sword, and raised his arm to chop. But it wasn&rsquo;t even necessary. The branches parted on their own to let him through. To his astonishment, the prince saw a magnificent palace. He saw the sleeping gardener, the sleeping lady-in-waiting, and he saw beautiful halls, and he couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. When he reached the attic and opened the small door, he saw a spinning wheel, and beside it lay a sleeping girl on the wooden floor.</p>
		<p>This must be the princess, thought the prince. He leaned over her. She really existed, and yes, she was as beautiful as everyone said. Unable to resist, he kissed her, and then&hellip; then Sleeping Beauty slowly opened her eyes.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>You know the rest. Not long after, they married each other. The princess went to bed very late every night and got up again at dawn the next morning. For she had already done enough sleeping.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time&mdash;oh, a very long time ago&mdash;there was a poor tailor who, besides having three sons, only had a goat. He had nothing else. And he was kinder to that goat than to his sons. Just listen.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Every day, one of the three boys had to take the goat to the meadow. When it was the oldest's turn again, he took the animal to a spot where the tastiest grass grew. At the end of the day, he asked, &ldquo;Did you eat enough?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get another blade down my throat,&rdquo; replied the goat. When the son came home, the first thing the father asked was, &ldquo;Did you let the goat eat well?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t get another blade down her throat.&rdquo; I already told you that the father was so fond of his goat, didn&rsquo;t I? Well, he immediately went to the stable and asked the goat, &ldquo;Did you eat enough today?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Pfff, enough?&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;My stomach is still growling from hunger.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The father became very angry. &ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; he shouted at his son and unceremoniously kicked him out of the house. Can you believe it? He believed his goat more than his son!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, the second son had to take the goat to the meadow. He took her to a spot with the tastiest clover. At the end of the day, he asked the goat, &ldquo;Did you eat well?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get another leaf down my throat,&rdquo; said the goat. Once back home, his father asked, &ldquo;And? Did the goat eat well?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the son, &ldquo;she couldn&rsquo;t get another leaf down her throat.&rdquo; The father went to the stable, and again the goat said she was still hungry. The father became very angry again, grabbed a stick, and chased the second son out the door. The next day, the same thing happened with the third son, and he too was thrown out into the street.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Well, now the father had to take the goat to the meadow himself. At the end of the day, he asked her if she had eaten enough. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get another bite down my throat,&rdquo; said the goat. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;then we can go home.&rdquo; And at home in the stable, he said contentedly to the goat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you at least ate well today.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Pfff, ate well?&rdquo; said the goat. &ldquo;My stomach is still growling from hunger.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You wicked liar,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you!&rdquo; He grabbed her, shaved her head bald, and chased her out the door.</p>
		<p>And there sat the father now&mdash;all alone. He regretted what he had done to his sons and really wanted them to come home, but he didn&rsquo;t know where they were&hellip;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. The oldest son had gone to work for a carpenter. But after a year, he missed his family and wanted to go home very much. The carpenter gave him a little table as a farewell gift&mdash;not just any table, but a magical one. If you said, &ldquo;Table, set yourself!&rdquo; the most delicious dishes appeared on the tabletop, and you could eat your fill.</p>
		<p>The boy thanked the carpenter, put the table on his back, and began the long journey home. On the way, he wanted to see if it really was such a special table. He set it down on the grass and said, &ldquo;Table, set yourself!&rdquo; And yes, hardly had he said it when a platter of roasted chicken legs and a large glass of fresh orange juice appeared on the table.</p>
		<p>When evening fell, he went into an inn. It was filled with people, and soon it became very lively. &ldquo;Shall I show you something?&rdquo; asked the boy after a few glasses of wine.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>He placed the table in the middle of the tavern and said, &ldquo;Table, set yourself!&rdquo; Well, you can imagine that everyone fell out of their chairs in astonishment when the most delicious food appeared.</p>
		<p>The innkeeper saw everything happen and thought: I must have that table!</p>
		<p>Around midnight, the oldest son went to his room. He set the table in a corner and fell asleep like a log.</p>
		<p>A little later, the door quietly opened. The innkeeper sneaked in. He had a table with him that looked exactly like the magical table and quietly swapped them out.</p>
		<p>The next day, the boy took the table on his back and set off again. When he got home that evening, the father was so happy to have at least one son back that he invited the whole neighborhood for dinner. &ldquo;And what do you have with you?&rdquo; everyone asked curiously.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Just wait,&rdquo; said the oldest son. He had all the neighbors stand in a circle around the table, spread his arms, and said solemnly, &ldquo;Table, set yourself!&rdquo; But of course, nothing happened. Everyone laughed at him. The oldest son scratched his head. He didn&rsquo;t understand at all.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The second son had ended up working for a miller. And after a year, he too wanted to go back home. His boss gave him a donkey as a farewell gift&mdash;a very special one, because if you said &ldquo;Donkey, stretch yourself!&rdquo; five coins would come out of its behind or its mouth.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>He took the donkey by a rope, and as soon as he could no longer see the mill, he stopped and said, &ldquo;Donkey, stretch yourself!&rdquo; And sure enough, a little later, he walked on contentedly with five coins in his pocket.</p>
		<p>That evening, he ended up in the same inn where his brother had slept. He brought the donkey to the stable, asked for the nicest room, and ordered an extensive meal. &ldquo;How much do I have to pay?&rdquo; the boy asked when he was done eating.</p>
		<p>This boy must be rich, thought the innkeeper, because after all, he wants the nicest room? I&rsquo;ll just ask three coins more than usual. &ldquo;Nine coins,&rdquo; he said without hesitation. The boy only had five coins in his pocket, but that was, of course, no problem. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The innkeeper secretly followed him to the stable and peeked through a crack in the wooden door. When he heard what the boy said to the donkey and saw the coins come out of the donkey, he thought to himself: I want a donkey like that! And while the boy was snoring in his fancy room later that evening, the innkeeper quietly exchanged the magical donkey for an ordinary one.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, the boy took the animal by the rope and continued on his way. When he knocked on his father&rsquo;s door that evening, the father was so happy to have his second son back. &ldquo;So, did you bring a donkey?&rdquo; he said. Again, all the neighbors came by, and the second son let them stand in a circle around the donkey. &ldquo;Donkey, stretch yourself!&rdquo; he called solemnly.</p>
		<p>But again nothing happened, and he too was laughed at by everyone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey, what a coincidence,&rdquo; said the oldest brother, &ldquo;that happened to me too.&rdquo; Soon it became clear that they had slept in the same inn, and they realized that the innkeeper had swapped the magical table and donkey. What a mean trickster! They decided to go to the inn to get the table and donkey back, but they didn&rsquo;t know how to go about it yet.</p>
		<p>And what had happened to the youngest son in the meantime? He had gone to work for a woodcarver, and after a year he also wanted to return to his father. As a farewell gift, he received a burlap sack.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Pay attention, this is a special sack,&rdquo; said the woodcarver. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wooden club inside. If you&rsquo;re robbed by a thief, you just call out, &lsquo;Club, out of the sack!&rsquo; and the club will beat the thief until you say, &lsquo;Club, in the sack!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The youngest son said goodbye to his boss and set off for home.</p>
		<p>When it began to get dark, he met his brothers near the inn. They told him what had happened, and the three brothers devised a plan together.</p>
		<p>The oldest and the middle brother looked for a sleeping spot under a tree, not far from the inn. The youngest went into the inn.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I want a room that can be locked well,&rdquo; he said to the innkeeper, &ldquo;because I have a sack that is worth its weight in gold.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The innkeeper immediately thought: A sack worth its weight in gold, I must have that&hellip;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And at night, when everyone was asleep and it was dead quiet in the inn, the innkeeper quietly climbed through a window into the youngest son&rsquo;s room. Just as he was about to make off with the sack, the youngest son shouted: &ldquo;Club, out of the sack!&rdquo; The club flew out of the sack and mercilessly beat the innkeeper. The innkeeper screamed, but the boy was not impressed. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t quickly return my brothers&rsquo; table and donkey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you beaten to a pulp.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ow, ow,&rdquo; moaned the innkeeper, &ldquo;yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll give them back, ow, ow!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Club, in the sack!&rdquo; said the boy, and so the brothers got their table and donkey back, and the three of them set off for home.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Of course, that was a party! The whole neighborhood was there again and this time no one laughed at them when the oldest son shouted &lsquo;Table, set yourself!&rsquo; and the second son shouted &lsquo;Donkey, stretch yourself!&rsquo;. On the contrary! Everyone enjoyed the delicious food and it was a real party when they all got a few coins. Then everyone looked at the youngest son, but he quickly said: &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring anything!&rsquo; Because of course he didn&rsquo;t want the club to come out of the bag.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Sure! Here&rsquo;s the translation of that passage:</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And the goat? That wicked liar? She was so ashamed of her shorn head that she hid in a fox's den. When the fox came home that evening and saw the two shining eyes of the goat in the dark, he was so startled that he fled into the woods. There he met a bear. Together, they went back to the den. But the bear was also frightened and ran away. The fox and the bear called for the help of a bee, which stung the goat on her bald head. The goat jumped out of the den with a scream and ran like crazy into the woods. No one knows what happened to that goat. Maybe she is still running to this day. Who knows&hellip;</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A LONG, LONG TIME AGO, there was once a man and a woman who were very happy because the woman was expecting a baby! Often, she sat by the attic window and looked down into her neighbor's garden, which was filled with the most beautiful flowers and even had vegetables and herbs growing. She would have loved to walk in that garden to smell all those flowers, but she couldn't because the garden belonged to a mean, wicked witch. Everyone was afraid of her &ndash; people said she could cast spells!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, the woman was again sitting by the attic window knitting a baby jacket. In the witch's little garden, she saw rows of cucumbers, carrots, green beans, and rapunzel, a type of lettuce. Suddenly, she got an awful craving for that rapunzel. She called her husband and said that she would die if she didn&rsquo;t get a plate of rapunzel quickly.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But that rapunzel belongs to that wicked witch!&rdquo; the man said, startled.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; the woman said, starting to cry. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get a plate of rapunzel soon, I will die.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Well, of course, the man didn&rsquo;t want that. So there was nothing for it: he had to try to get into that garden. The man waited until it was dark and then quietly, without making a sound, climbed over the high wall and tiptoed to the garden. He was just about to grab a handful of rapunzel when the witch suddenly stood before him! That was a shock!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she hissed furiously. &ldquo;What are you doing there with my rapunzel?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;My wife is expecting a child,&rdquo; stammered the man, &ldquo;and she has such a craving for rapunzel that she might die if she doesn&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The witch stroked her long chin, squinted her eyes into slits, and said, &ldquo;So, so, a child is coming. Yes, yes. And without that rapunzel, your wife might die.&rdquo; She paused for a moment and then continued: &ldquo;Well, fine. You may have my rapunzel, but when the child is born, it is mine.&rdquo; The man was so scared &ndash; just imagine if she turned him into a spider or something! &ndash; that he did nothing but nod and then hurried away with a sack full of rapunzel.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And sure enough, on the day the child was born, the witch suddenly appeared in the room, snatched the baby from the cradle, and disappeared before the parents could do anything. It was a girl, and the witch named her Rapunzel. She took her to a hut deep in the woods and was never seen again.</p>
		<p>Rapunzel grew up and became a very beautiful girl. The witch, who was almost bald herself, was very proud of Rapunzel's lovely hair. She thought it was a shame to cut it off. Because of that, Rapunzel walked around with braids that were ten times longer than she was.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When Rapunzel turned twelve, the witch locked her in a tall tower, not far from the hut. Why she did that, nobody knows, and it was a special tower, for it had no door. There was only a window, high up, just below the roof. So no one could reach the girl. But how did she get food, you wonder? Well, the witch brought it. Twice a day, she stood with a basket of food at the foot of the tower and called out:</p>
		<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, <br />Throw down your hair in a while!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then Rapunzel would wind her long braids around a hook beside the window and let them down, and the witch would climb up the hair to her.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, a prince rode through the forest on his horse. He had been wandering for days when he suddenly heard a girl singing. That was strange, right in the middle of the dense forest! He rode toward the singing, and there he saw a tower through the trees, and Rapunzel stood by the window. What a beautiful girl, the prince thought to himself.</p>
		<p>At that moment, an old woman came walking up. She had a large basket with her, stood at the foot of the tower, and called up:</p>
		<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, <br />Throw down your hair in a while!</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>Two golden braids fell down, and he saw how the woman climbed up them. After a while, the witch climbed back down the braids and disappeared among the trees. The prince stepped out from behind the bushes. The girl was no longer at the window, so he called out:</p>
		<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, <br />Throw down your hair in a while!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And sure enough, there came the braids! The prince climbed up. Rapunzel was, of course, very surprised when a stranger, not the witch, stepped through the window. He was a very handsome prince, so it was no wonder that she immediately fell in love with him. And he fell in love with her too, by the way. They chatted for a bit, and he promised that he would come back the next day. And he did &ndash; not just the next day but every day after that, but only at night because the witch could come during the day.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, when the witch was with her, Rapunzel let it slip. &ldquo;You are much heavier than the prince who comes here every evening,&rdquo; she accidentally said. Oops, it slipped out before she knew it!</p>
		<p>The witch was first speechless, and then she became very angry. Without saying a word, she grabbed a big knife and cut &ndash; snip snap &ndash; off Rapunzel's braids! She tied them to the hook next to the window, forced Rapunzel to climb out, and then climbed down after her. The witch pushed Rapunzel ahead of her deep into the forest. In a lonely dark place, the witch left Rapunzel alone in the woods, without food and without drink.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The witch quickly returned to the tower. She climbed up the braids, brought them inside, and stood fuming in the middle of the room. With her hands on her hips, she hissed: &ldquo;So, prince, come on. Then you'll see what happens!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When evening came, she heard him calling:</p>
		<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, <br />Throw down your hair in a while!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The witch threw down the braids, and the prince climbed up unsuspectingly. When he wanted to step inside, the witch gave him a hard blow on the head and pushed him out the window. He fell into a bramble bush, landed with his eyes in the thorns, and then he was blind. The story keeps getting sadder...</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The prince wandered around in the great forest, and somewhere else in that same forest, Rapunzel wandered as well. They ate berries and drank from forest brooks. This went on for years.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But then things happily turned brighter again, because one day, they happened to come across each other. He heard a girl singing and immediately recognized Rapunzel's voice. Rapunzel cried terribly when she saw that the prince was blind. Her tears fell onto his eyes and... suddenly he could see again.</p>
		<p>Together they went to his castle, where they married and lived happily ever after.</p>
		<p>They certainly deserved that after so much misery!</p>

		<p>**Once upon a time**, there was a soldier who returned from a war. At home, he was told that his father had died. His brothers had divided everything their father owned among themselves. So there was nothing left for the soldier. The oldest brother felt sorry for him and gave him a silver coin as a consolation. One silver coin was all he received. The soldier put the silver coin in his pocket. Since he no longer had a home, he set off into the wide world.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One evening, he came to a large forest. An old, thin man in torn clothes asked him if he had any money, as he was very hungry. The soldier thought: no way! I only have that silver coin, and I want to buy bread with it. But he saw how the old man was trembling from hunger. So he took out the coin and said, "Here, please, I am young and strong; I can go a day without food."</p>
		<p>At that moment, the old man turned into a young prince. Instead of rags, he was now wearing a beautiful outfit, sparkling with pearls and gemstones.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"I am the wizard of this forest," he said, "and because you wanted to give me your coin, I will reward you for your kindness. You may make a wish, and I will fulfill it. Just tell me what you want!"</p>
		<p>The young man thought for a moment and then said, "I have always wanted to know what it is like to be an animal. I wish to be able to turn into a hare, a bird, or a fish." "That is a beautiful wish," said the wizard, "and your wish is already granted." And at that moment, he vanished into thin air.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Can I really turn into a hare? the young man thought. And yes, indeed: there he was, a hare. And just like that, he was a fish for a moment, and a little later, a bird!</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>Satisfied, the young man continued on his way and soon arrived in a village. There, the king was visiting, looking for soldiers to wage war against another country. "Would you like to become a soldier in my army?" he asked the young man. The young man was eager to do so, as he had been a soldier before, and at least he would earn some money.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then came the day when the king summoned all the soldiers. It was time to start the war. The next morning, they departed at dawn.</p>
		<p>Now, you should know that this king had nothing to fear. He possessed a very special ring that ensured he won all his wars. So, when they saw the enemy in the distance after three days, the king was not worried at all.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The enemy stood in ten tight rows, ready for battle. Just as the king was about to give the signal to attack, he discovered that he did not have his ring with him. It was at home on his nightstand!</p>
		<p>Retrieving the ring would take three days there and three days back; that would take six days. Four, perhaps, if someone was very fast. That was far too long. What if the enemy attacked? The king was at a loss and desperately cried out, "Whoever can fetch the ring for me and return before evening may marry my daughter!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Our soldier stepped forward and said he would give it a try. He left the camp, hid behind a rock, quickly transformed into a hare, and jumped away. But someone had seen what had happened: an older soldier who was jealous of him because the young man belonged to the royal guard and he did not.</p>
		<p>The young man ran like a hare over hills and through valleys. When he reached a river, he transformed into a fish and shot through the water like an arrow from a bow. At a mountain, he turned into a bird, and shortly after, he flew into the princess's room. There, he transformed back into himself.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The princess was a little startled when she suddenly saw a strange young man in her room, but he quickly explained why he had come, and she understood there was no time to lose. She hurried to her father's nightstand.</p>
		<p>When she handed him the ring, they looked deeply into each other&rsquo;s eyes and immediately fell deeply in love.</p>
		<p>Then the young man did something very clever that would help him later on. "Pay close attention," he said, "and do exactly as I ask." And he transformed into a hare. "Cut a piece from my tail," he said.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then he quickly transformed into a fish. "Pull two scales from my back," he said. And finally, he changed into a bird. "Pluck two feathers from my wing," he said, "and keep all these things safe." And away he flew out the window, back to the king.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>On the way, he transformed back into a fish and finally arrived as a hare at the camp, with the ring clamped between his teeth. The jealous soldier saw the hare coming, grabbed his rifle, and... shot!</p>
		<p>The creature tumbled over. Dead as a doornail. The jealous soldier quickly snatched the ring from its mouth and handed it to the king. He put the ring on his finger, and you guessed it: he won the war.</p>
		<p>Back in the palace, the king went with the jealous soldier to his daughter. "Thanks to this good soldier, we have won the war," he said to her. "So he may marry you. I promised him that. The wedding is the day after tomorrow."</p>
		<p>The princess began to cry. She said that the man was a liar, but the king did not believe her. The princess continued to cry, even on the day of the wedding, and well... a crying bride, that simply could not be, so the celebration was postponed by a day.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the wizard of the forest looked into his crystal ball and saw the hare dead in the field. He rubbed the ball, made a few magical gestures, and said, "Become alive again, hare! Get up and hurry to your princess, for she is marrying someone else tomorrow."</p>
		<p>The hare blinked his eyes, jumped up, and ran to the palace. On the way, he first transformed back into a fish and then into a bird until he ultimately stood before the king as a soldier. "I have come to claim my reward," he said. "I fetched the ring for you, so I may marry your daughter. You said so yourself."</p>
		<p>"That is not true," said the king. "I received the ring from another soldier, not from you." But he was not entirely sure of his case, so he called for his daughter. She immediately threw her arms around the soldier.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"Father," she cried joyfully, "this is the soldier who fetched the ring! Not the other one. The other one is a fraud."</p>
		<p>"Who should I believe now?" said the king, completely confused. The princess ran to her room and came back with a golden box. She took out the tuft of hare's tail. The soldier transformed into a hare. Now the king could see that the tuft of tail fit perfectly into the bald spot on the hare's tail.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then the princess produced the two scales. The soldier transformed into a fish. The king could see for himself that two scales were missing from the back.</p>
		<p>Finally, the king saw with his own eyes that the bird was missing two feathers in its wings. And the princess held those two feathers in her hand...</p>
		<p>The fraud received a hundred lashes and was thrown out of the palace, never to show himself again.</p>
		<p>The soldier married his princess. A few years later, the king died, and the soldier became king.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Sometimes, when he wanted to see how things were going in his kingdom, he flew like a dove over his land, or looked like a fish from the water, or hid like a hare among the bushes. In this way, he learned all sorts of things and could take good care of his people.</p>
		<p>He became the best king the land had ever had.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time &mdash; long, long ago &mdash; there was a fisherman who was so poor that he lived with his wife in an upside-down flower pot. The fisherman didn&rsquo;t mind this; it was just how it was, and in fact, it was quite cozy. Every morning, he walked to the sea at dawn, and he only returned home late in the afternoon with the fish he had caught. He never experienced anything special until one certain day...</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>On that day, he caught a fish that could talk. "If you throw me back into the sea, I will reward you," said the fish. "You may make a wish, and I will fulfill it."</p>
		<p>The man was, as mentioned, a content man, so he said, &ldquo;Oh little flounder&rdquo; &mdash; because that&rsquo;s what he had caught: a flounder, which is a type of fish &mdash; &ldquo;little flounder, what should I wish for? I have a wife, I have food to eat every day, and I have a roof over my head. I don&rsquo;t need anything more.&rdquo; After saying this, he threw the flounder back into the sea. The fish disappeared underwater, and the fisherman went home. That evening, when he and his wife were in bed, he told her about the fish.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Could you really make a wish?&rdquo; asked his wife. &ldquo;And what did you wish for?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;We have nothing to wish for.&rdquo; </p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>That night, the wife thought long and hard, and the next morning she said, &ldquo;Actually, I do have something to wish for.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the man, surprised, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;I would like to live in a real house like everyone else,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;instead of in an upside-down flower pot.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Do you mean that I should ask the flounder for a house?&rdquo; asked the man. <br />&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;a small, simple house with walls, windows, a roof, and a chimney. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be big.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The fisherman loved to see his wife happy, so the next day he went to the sea, gathered his courage, and called out:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea, <br />Here is little man Timpetee. <br />My dearest wife Elsebil <br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The sea was calm, there was not a breath of wind, and nothing happened at all&hellip;</p>
		<p><br />---</p>
		<p>The man was about to go home when the flounder poked its head above the water and asked, &ldquo;Well, what does she want?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; said the man hesitantly, &ldquo;she would like to live in a real house&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s already living in a house.&rdquo; And it was gone again, underwater.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned,&rdquo; said the man, and he went straight home. And yes, there stood, instead of the upside-down flower pot, a real little house with straight walls, a roof, a chimney, and windows with cheerful curtains. Everything was neatly painted. His wife came to meet him with open arms. <br />&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful little house?&rdquo; she exclaimed joyfully. &ldquo;And just look how cozy it is inside. This is certainly something else compared to an upside-down flower pot.&rdquo; <br />The man had to admit that. It had been dark as night in the flower pot all day, and now light streamed in through the three windows. There was space for a table and two chairs, and &mdash; what a surprise! &mdash; there was even an extra little room for sleeping.</p>
		<p>The wife was over the moon with happiness. Singing, she kept the little house tidy. But after a few weeks, she said one evening in bed to her husband, &ldquo;This house is quite cozy and nice, but it is also very cramped. We could use a bit more space. If you could ask the flounder for a bigger house tomorrow&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;But I was only allowed to make one wish,&rdquo; said the man. <br />&ldquo;Oh, one wish more or less,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;what does it matter? After all, he owes his life to you.&rdquo; His wife might have had a point, so when he stood by the sea the next morning, he called out:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea, <br />Here is little man Timpetee. <br />My dearest wife Elsebil <br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The man waited anxiously. The sea was choppy, and yes, thankfully, there was the flounder. <br />&ldquo;Well, what does she want now?&rdquo; it asked. <br />&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;she is very happy with the little house, but it is quite cramped. She would actually really like a bit more space&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;Go home, she is already living in a big house.&rdquo; And he disappeared again into the waves.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And what a big house it was! It had not three but ten large tall windows and a wide terrace. His wife was waiting for him, beaming: &ldquo;Well, what do you think? Quite different from that tiny hut, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo; <br />And that was true. The living room was ten times bigger. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; said the wife. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad you asked for it?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Yes, that was a good idea,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but are you satisfied now?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Yes, what do you think!&rdquo; said the wife, proudly showing him five large bedrooms.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But after two weeks, the wife said, &ldquo;This house is beautiful and large, but it all needs to be kept clean, and that&rsquo;s no fun.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;What do you want then?&rdquo; asked the man, startled. <br />&ldquo;A few maids, for example, to help me,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;and also ask the flounder for a cook and someone to do the laundry, and someone for the garden too.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day there was a strong wind, and the waves crashed high against the rocks. The fisherman stood by the sea and called out in the wind:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea, <br />Here is little man Timpetee. <br />My dearest wife Elsebil <br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, what does she want now?&rdquo; asked the flounder, who immediately came up. <br />&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;the house is really very spacious, and we are very happy with that, but it also means a lot of work. She thought that if she had some help&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder, &ldquo;she already has help.&rdquo; <br />His wife was standing at the front door. She clapped her hands twice, and twelve servants came out and stood neatly in a row. <br />&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;they do all the work now.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;did you ever think you would have twelve servants one day? Now you must be satisfied.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t be?&rdquo; said the wife. She folded her hands over her chest and looked content as the servants went to work.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>A few days went by quietly, but then the wife started complaining again. &ldquo;I like being in charge of people, but it&rsquo;s a pity there are only twelve of them. I would like to be in charge of many more people.&rdquo; And after thinking for another day, she said, &ldquo;Man, I want to be queen! Then I will be in charge of a lot of people. And I want a palace. Ask the flounder for that tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The man protested vehemently, but the wife said angrily that she would be very unhappy if she didn&rsquo;t become queen. So, what do you do?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next morning, it was very windy. The trees swayed back and forth, and the waves had white caps. The man had to shout to make himself heard:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea, <br />Here is little man Timpetee. <br />My dearest wife Elsebil <br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The flounder appeared again. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;what does she want now?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;She wants to become queen,&rdquo; said the man with his head bowed, &ldquo;and she wants a palace&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;She is already queen, and she has a palace.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And indeed&hellip; There stood a large snow-white palace shining in the sun, and inside sat his wife on a throne, in a long dress of red velvet. Around her shoulders was a long red cloak. On her head, she wore a golden crown. Along the walls stood footmen and ladies-in-waiting, all waiting for what the queen would command. The fisherman approached his wife hesitantly. <br />&ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; he said in awe, &ldquo;you look wonderful! Are you really a queen now? Does everyone have to do what you say? Well, now you must be truly satisfied.&rdquo; <br />His wife said nothing; she merely nodded to a footman. He showed him around the palace. It had so many halls and rooms that the man lost count.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a few days, when they were lying in the great royal bed in the evening, the fisherman's wife &mdash; who was now queen &mdash; sat up straight. &ldquo;If the flounder can make me queen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he can also make me empress, and then I&rsquo;ll be in charge of everyone! Man, tomorrow you tell your flounder that I want to be empress.&rdquo;<br />The man wanted to say something, but the wife shook him and shouted, &ldquo;I am queen, and you are just a poor fisherman. So you just do what I say, understood?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>With lead in his shoes, the man walked to the sea the next day. The waves were towering, and the wind was roaring. The man shouted:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea,<br />Here is little man Timpetee.<br />My dearest wife Elsebil<br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a very long time, the flounder came up. &ldquo;Well, what does she want this time?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;She&hellip; she wants to become empress,&rdquo; said the fisherman softly. He just hoped the flounder didn&rsquo;t hear him.<br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;She is already empress.&rdquo; And it disappeared into the raging waves.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Now there stood a palace as large as a village! The man had to ask for directions to the throne room, which was now much bigger. All the way at the other end, his wife sat on a high golden throne, her cloak shimmering and sparkling with gemstones. The hall was filled with kings, counts, and dukes, all bowing before her. His wife was now the most powerful in the whole land.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>That evening, from the imperial bed, the woman looked out the window and saw the moon rise. &ldquo;Everyone does what I want,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;even the king does what I want. But that moon, it does what it wants.&rdquo; She shook the fisherman awake. &ldquo;Man, I want the moon to do what I want. Get up, right now! Go to your flounder and tell him I want to be God.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Be God?&rdquo; stammered the man. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible&hellip;&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t get any further because his wife had already kicked him out of bed.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Black clouds had covered the moon, a storm was rising, rain lashed against his face, the sea churned as if stirred with a giant spoon. The wind almost blew him over. The fisherman whispered:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea,<br />Here is little man Timpetee.<br />My dearest wife Elsebil<br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;What does she want now?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;She&hellip; she&hellip; wants to be God&hellip;&rdquo; whispered the fisherman.<br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s back in a flower pot.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Well&hellip;</p>
